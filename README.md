# aspNetCore-Angular-project
## This project is an API wich return a serialize of Car's Makers and Models.
Source code of my ASP .NET Core and Angular porject.
## In this project I want to use a MySql remote Data Base.
### The project is for Back-end testing with Queries.
notes:
I needed to use dotnet add package Pomelo... to use correctly the UseMySql Statement <br>
also check the versions of the .csproj to more information. dont forget to install de SDK of .net core. <br>
I use 3.1 (I think). using dotnet ef you will see if you needed or not the dotnet.app SDK.
